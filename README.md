# Neural models to prove neuronal concepts?

2024-06-10

**Lay summary**<br>
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are yet powerful, mathematical models largely used for decision making or classification. Due to the complexity of the brain, e.g. different cell types, circuits, ways of how neurons communicate or adapt to distinct stimuli, ANNs mimic only partially the brain's function. Considering all these aspects, I found it intriguing that several recent studies used simple ANNs to prove neuropathological concepts related to neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental conditions (i.e. Alzheimer's disease or autism spectrum disorder). Having spent years in deciphering molecular mechanisms related to neurodegeneration and autism, I here wanted to test whether ANNs are indeed able to "prove" one or the other concept linked to autism spectrum disorder development. Based on my results, I, for my part, come to the conclusion that (current) ANNs should not be used to "prove" neurobiological concepts.
